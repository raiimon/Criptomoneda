        <p class="principal-text">8 years after its creation, Bitcoin has revalued so much that it has reformulated the rules of the financial game
          around the world.</p>
        <p class="principal-text">And nowadays its value continues to increase in such a way that every day new entrepreneurs are necessarily learning
          how to earn money with bitcoins.</p>

        <label class="text-or" style="color: green">Bitcoin Mining and Antminer S9</label>
        <div class="customHr"></div>

        <p class="principal-text">If this is the first time you set up an Antminer S9, then you may find yourself a little lost on how to connect your
          bitcoin miner to join a pool or mining pool. </p>
        <p class="principal-text">This guide will help you to follow all the necessary steps to configure your Antminer from 0 and start mining in
          a matter of minutes. </p>

      </ion-list>

      <ion-list no-lines>

        <label class="text-or" style="color: green">Initial Configuration</label>
        <div class="customHr"></div>

        <p class="principal-text">Connect the Bitmain power supply to the miner. The S9 consumes 1390 Watts and employs 9 PCI-E (6-pin) power connectors
          plus an additional PCI-E connector for the controller board.</p>

        <p class="principal-text">Connect the network cable to the LAN port located in the front area of the S9. Connect the power supply to the power
          outlet.
        </p>
        <p class="principal-text"> The miner will start. This process may take a few minutes.</p>

        <label class="text-or" style="color: green">Find your IP in your Antminer Machine</label>
        <div class="customHr"></div>

        <p class="principal-text">To find the IP address of the Antminer, you need to start your miner and connect it to the router using the cable
          of LAN network. Once the miner connects to the Internet, it will generate its own IP address. </p>

        <p class="principal-text"> To configure the miner, you must log in to that IP address through your Internet browser from a PC From the configuration
          page of the router we can determine the IP of the S9, or through an IP browser program, as we will see below. </p>

        <p class="principal-text"> Download the Advanced IP Address Scanner. Install the IP scanner and once open press "start" to start scanning. If
          you are using a LAN cable to access the Internet, you will see the name "Antminer" in the IP scanner. </p>

        <p class="principal-text">You are using WiFi, you will probably not see any name, but you can see the address of Manufacturing            or
          Mac to identify which one is the Antminer. The manufacturer of Antminer is listed as "Texas Instruments",         
          and the MAC address always starts with "84: EB: ...". Once you have determined the Antminer IP address,         
          copy and paste the address in the URL of your browser.</p>

      <label class="text-or" style="color: green">Accessing the Antminer interface</label>
      <div class="customHr"></div>

      <p class="principal-text">When you access the Antminer interface for the first time, you will be asked for a password.</p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://tecnobits.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/miner-login.png">

      <p class="principal-text">The default factory logon of S9 is as follows:</p>

      <p class="principal-text">Username: root</p>
      <p class="principal-text">Password: root</p>

      <p class="principal-text">Once inside, from the "System" tab you can check the current status of the miner: the activity, speed of          hash,
        core temperature and frequency, among other statistics. </p>

      <p class="principal-text">As you can see there are other tabs available: "Miner Configuration", "Miner Status" and "Network". To configure        
        S9 accesses the "Miner Configuration" tab and then click on "General Settings". From here we go          to connect
        the Antminer to a mining pool.</p>
    </ion-card-content>

    <img class="myphoto" src="https://tecnobits.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/miner-config.png">

    <p class="principal-text">The AntMiner S9 can be configured with three mining pools, with a decreasing priority from the first group (pool      
      1) to the third group (pool 3). In each section we will see 3 boxes to fill in: Pool URL: enter the URL of your      
      Mining pool Worker: the ID of your team in the selected pool Password: a password for your team (it is not necessary)
             To complete this data, we must open an account in a mining pool. Next we will see how to configure        the
      miner with the mining pools of Antpool and Slushpool.</p>

    <label class="text-or" style="color: green">Configuration with Antpool</label>
    <div class="customHr"></div>

    <p class="principal-text">To register in Antpool you must first create a new user account through Bitmain (the Antpool website)        it will
      redirect us automatically). </p>

    <p class="principal-text"> Enter your email address and a valid password. You will be sent an email to the email address that you indicated      
      with an activation link. Click on the link to confirm your email address. </p>

    <p class="principal-text">Next, you must indicate a mobile phone number. Choose your country of residence, enter your mobile number,        and
      click on "send SMS". You must receive a code, enter it in the corresponding box (Sms code) and click        in "Creatte
      account".</p>

    <p class="principal-text">Now enter the home page (or "Dashboard") of your Antpool account. From here we will have several options available,      
      how to verify the number of connected workers, our balance of payments, etc.</p>

    <img class="myphoto" src="https://tecnobits.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ant1.jpg">

    <p class="principal-text">To be able to mine in Antpool we must create a sub-account. To do so, go to "Settings" and then "Add Sub Account".</p>

    <p class="principal-text">Enter a name of your choice ("technobits", "johndoe", etc) and click on "Create". This pseudonym will serve to      
      identify our miner in the Antpool pool.</p>

    <img class="myphoto" src="https://tecnobits.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/wal2.jpg">

    <p class="principal-text">Once created, click on the "Edit" button. In the "Wallet Address" option insert your Bitcoin address. </p>

    <p class="principal-text">If you have not yet obtained a wallet address, you can create one in Coinbase through the following link: https://www.coinbase.com/join/595fa92a254a9e01a5819350
    </p>

    <p class="principal-text">In the "Payments" option, select PPS if you are going to undermine irregularly or PPLNS if you plan to mine consistently
             The 24 hours of the day.</p>

    <p class="principal-text">Now you must configure the miner with the Antpool configuration. Save the changes and go back to the Dashboard, and copy
             the address of the Stratum servers of Antpool.</p>

    <img class="myphoto" src="https://tecnobits.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/serverantpool.jpg">

    <p class="principal-text">Go back to the S9 configuration interface (“Miner Configuration/General Settings”). </p>


    <p class="principal-text">You will see that there are 3 groups of boxes where we must enter the data of the mining pools, these are "Pool 1", "Pool
             2 "and" Pool 3 ". </p>

    <p class="principal-text">The S9 will use the first address by default and will use the other 2 only as backup.</p>

    <p class="principal-text">Copy the first address of the Stratum server from Antpool and paste it in the "URL" box.</p>

    <a>stratum+tcp://stratum.antpool.com:3333</a>

    <p class="principal-text">In the "Worker" box, you must first insert the name of the sub-account that you previously configured followed by a      
      point, and then a name of your choice for the Antminer (example: "tecnobits.worker1", "johndoe.worker1",        etc)
    </p>


    <p class="principal-text">URL: stratum+tcp://stratum.antpool.com:3333 </p>


    <p class="principal-text">Fill in the other boxes with the address of servers 2 and 3 of Antpool and the name of your sub-account, and finally
             click on Save.</p>


    <img class="myphoto" src="https://tecnobits.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/s9antpool1.jpg">

    <p class="principal-text">You're almost finished Now you can check from the "Miner Status" tab that the team is mining correctly.        After
      10 minutes or so, you can see the Antwerp hashrate from the "Worker" tab on the Antpool website.</p>
