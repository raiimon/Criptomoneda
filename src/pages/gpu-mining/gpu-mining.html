      <p class="principal-text">Ethereum is quite difficult to get mining on windows - although with a bit of help and
        following the tutorial
        below you can get it up and running and start your own ethereum mining project in 15 mins.</p>
      <p class="principal-text">Running a CPU you might be able to generate 0.15 Mega Hashes whilst with a decent GPU
        with enough memory you
        could be doing upwards 25 Mega Hashes (you can choose a GPU to mine ether here and use our guide on how to
        choose a GPU to mine ether). So in terms of total efficiency, taking into account electrical costs, a GPU
        is definitely worth it even if it costs you $200.</p>

      <label class="text-or" style="color: green">Installing GETH, Syncing the Blockchain and creating your own
        address!</label>
      <div class="customHr"></div>

      <p class="principal-text">The first thing you need to do is go to this link download Geth. Geth is the program
        that communicates with the
        Ethereum Network and acts as the a relay between your computer, its hardware and the rest of the ethereum
        network computers so if a block is mined by another computer your Geth program will pick it up and then pass
        on the new information onto your GPU or CPU for mining. </p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/20667/geth-ethereum.jpg">

      <p class="principal-text">You need to unzip the GETH file and move it to a location on your hard drive. In this
        case we'll move it to the
        hard drive, usually (C:) - which will make the next step easier. All you need to do is copy the file you
        have downloaded and unzipped and move it to the hard drive folder. </p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/20671/geth-c.jpg">

      <p class="principal-text">Now you need to run the program you just downloaded. To do this you need to run Command
        Prompt. You can do this
        by searching in the search function in Windows for "CMD" and then clicking on it when it shows up. </p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/20664/cmd-open.png">

      <p class="principal-text">Now you need to run the program you just downloaded. To do this you need to run Command
        Prompt. You can do this
        by searching in the search function in Windows for "CMD" and then clicking on it when it shows up. </p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/20664/cmd-open.png">

      <p class="principal-text"> Command Prompt is now open - and can look terrifying to people who aren't familiar with
        it. The Command Prompt
        box usually has C:\Users\Username> showing in it - where Username is your username - so if you log into your
        computer with the username cryptocompare then the command prompt box will open with C-Users-cryptocompare>.
        You need to tell the computer to look in another place Type cd / into the newly opened command prompt. You
        should now see "C:\", You have just used the cd command or "change directory" command to make command prompt
        look at the C:/ drive.</p>

      <p class="principal-text">You need to tell your Geth program to create a new account. As you have installed it in
        your user directory in
        Step 2 then it is just a simple case of typing in "geth account new" and then pressing return/enter. This
        should look like this "C:\>geth account new". </p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/20666/password-geth.jpg">

      <p class="principal-text">After hitting the enter button in Step 5, you will be asked to enter a password - N.B.
        you will not be able to
        see what you are typing in so type it carefully. This is the password that locks your account and keeps your
        Private key safe - if you lose this password you will lose all your Ether attached to the wallet held by
        that Private key. Once you have entered your password and confirmed it by entering it a second time you will
        have created a new account! Congratulations your about a third of the way there.</p>

      <p class="principal-text">You need to tell your Geth Program to start communicating with the rest of the Ethereum
        network. You do this
        by typing in "geth --rpc" - this should look like "C:\>geth --rpc" (on the latest version you should try:
        geth --rpc --fast --cache=1024) Press enter and the screen should start downloading the blockchain for Ethereum
        - at this point you are synchronising with the rest of the Ethereum network. This can take a while depending
        on your internet speed and the current size of the blockchain, anywhere between 20 min and multiple hours.
        Sometimes your firewall can block this process - just click allow access. Keep this cmd open, you will need
        this to run in the background in order to be able to mine. Also make sure you start mining only after your
        blockchain is synchronised, not before. Due to The DAO hard fork you will have to specify if you want to
        mine on the hard fork chain or on the chain without the hard fork. To mine Ethereum (ETH) use geth --rpc
        --support-dao-fork in order to mine Ethereum Classic (ETC) use: geth --rpc --oppose-dao-fork</p>

      <label class="text-or" style="color: green">Installing the Mining Software and Starting to Mine</label>
      <div class="customHr"></div>

      <p class="principal-text"> Now you need to download Ethminer which makes your GPU or CPU run the hashing algorithm
        that is integral to securing
        the Ethereum network through proof of work. You can download this here and be sure to scroll down to the
        bottom of the page to get the right version - the latest and most up to date one is right at the end.</p>

      <p class="principal-text">You need to open up another command prompt as in step 4 - so your going to get two scary
        looking boxes. Simply
        click right click on your already open command prompt in the taskbar at the bottom of the page and click
        on command prompt in the menu that appears. A new command prompt should open with "C:usersusername>". This
        is the wrong place to look for etherminer so you need to tell it the right place to find it.</p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/20672/2nd-cmd.png">

      <p class="principal-text">Type "cd /" into the newly opened command prompt which should look like this and then
        press enter. You should
        now see "C:\", You have just used the "cd" command or "change directory" command to make command prompt look
        at the C:/ drive - not your user file.</p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/20664/cmd-open.png">

      <p class="principal-text">Type in "cd prog" and then press the tab button. This should look like this C:\>cd prog
        and then press "tab"
        which will automatically complete the phrase for the closest fit found in the C: drive just like autotext
        does on your Iphone. After pressing "tab", you should see C:/> cd "Program Files" and press enter which should
        give you a new line saying "C:\Program Files>".</p>

      <p class="principal-text">Type in cd cpp and then press tab and then enter. This is taking you into the newly
        installed Ethereum Mining
        software folder. And this should look like this after pressing tab C:\Program Files>cd cpp-ethereum and pressing
        enter gives you C:\Program Files\cpp-ethereum>.</p>

      <p class="principal-text">GPU mining (only do this after your blockchain is synchronised): Type in ethminer -G and
        press enter and then
        you should start mining with your GPU after building a DAG file which can take around ten minutes. There
        can be problems at this point. For example the program might say that you have insufficient memory on your
        Graphics card to mine the with Ethereum's Ethash algorithm. If this is the case you can still mine with your
        CPU or go out and buy a new graphics card! You can see our graphics cards and compare their return on
        investments
        here and check out our guide on how to pick an ethereum mining graphics card here. We've also added a guide
        on how to build your ethereum mining rig.</p>
      <img class="myphoto" src="https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/350680/ethereum_ethminer_g.png">

      <p class="principal-text">CPU mining: Type in ethminer and press "enter" and you will start mining with your CPU.
        Again you will need to
        create a DAG file the first time you do this which can take some time. But after that is complete your Geth
        program downloaded in step 1 should start talking to your ethminer program and you should start mining!</p>

      <p class="principal-text">Hashing Power benchmark: If you want to get an estimation of your hashing power you can
        run ethminer -M (for
        CPU mining) or ethminer -G -M (for GPU mining). The command will run and you should get a result similar
        to the image bellow.</p>

    <label class="text-or" style="color: green">FAQ</label>
    <div class="customHr"></div>

    <p class="principal-text">If you are having issues getting your GPU to mine type ethminer --opencl-platform 1 to fix
      it for Nvidia. This usually
      happens when you have an integrated GPU as well as a dedicated one. </p>

    <p class="principal-text">If you are having issues finding peers, try to use: geth --nat=none</p>

    <p class="principal-text">If you are using ATI cards, in order to optimize your mining open a cmd prompt and
      run:</p>
    <p class="principal-text">setx GPU_FORCE_64BIT_PTR 0</p>
    <p class="principal-text">setx GPU_MAX_HEAP_SIZE 100</p>
    <p class="principal-text">setx GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS 1</p>


    <p class="principal-text">Also when you run ethminer, try using the extra params: --cl-global-work 16834
      --cl-local-work 256. </p>
